 Description

 TECHNICAL FIELD

5 [0001] The invention relates generally to antifreeze compositions exhibiting improved thermal stability at low temperatures.

 BACKGROUND

10 [0002] It is known to use antifreeze compositions in heat exchanging systems and/or for de-icing applications. In these
 applications, the antifreeze compositions come in contact with various metals, alloys, and other components forming
 the different parts of the heat exchanging system or the system to be de-iced. Efforts have been made towards the
 protection from corrosion of parts and components in contact with the antifreeze compositions. Prior art solutions include
 the addition of various corrosion inhibitors and/or the use of different organic acids for multiple metal protection systems.
15 [0003] Corrosion protection is critical at all temperature ranges. However, at low temperatures, other factors important
 to the performance of antifreeze compositions come into play, including the unwanted formation of scale and/or deposits.
 Water is often used to dilute antifreeze compositions. Water quality varies greatly with geographic location, population
 and degree of industrialization. When hard water is used, scales can be formed from alkaline earth metal carbonate and
 phosphate deposition. These inorganic films tend to inhibit thermal transfer and thus reduce the heat transfer efficiency
20 of the system. Besides the use of hard water, the use of certain corrosion inhibitors contributes to the formation of
 deposits, e.g., silicate gellation. In certain additive packages for coolants, silicate/phosphate corrosion inhibitors are
 used to help protect metal cooling system parts and also as a buffer to control the pH of the antifreeze. When a composition
 containing silicates/phosphates is mixed with hard water, copious precipitates develop in a short period of time. These
 precipitates may clog a cooling system, resulting in reduced antifreeze/coolant flow, increased engine operating tem25 peratures and shorter service life. Deposit formation can also result in the physical damage of soft material parts, e.g.,
 water pump seals, engine head seals, hoses, etc. used in the parts and components of the system.
 [0004] To alleviate the silicate deposit problem, silicate stabilizers can be added to antifreeze compositions. However,
 at low operating temperatures, e.g., sub-freezing, some additives are not soluble thus further compounding the problem.
 Ideally, antifreeze compositions should remain transparent and free of insoluble materials in operation as the unwanted
30 formation of deposits/soluble materials decreases the heat transfer property of the composition. And ideally, the antifreeze
 composition should be environmentally and toxicological friendly.
 [0005] US2006/163528 describes an aqueous antifreeze composition comprising 10- 50 wt. % of one or more C4C12 dicarboxylic acids in the form of the alkali metal, ammonium or alkaline earth metal salt.
 [0006] EP1449903 describes a coolant composition comprising a mixture of a C1-C2 carboxylic acid salt and a C335 C5 carboxylic acid salt.
 [0007] EP995785 describes an engine coolant combining aliphatic and aromatic WO2007/076511 describes a heat
 transfer fluid comprising a C3 carboxylate freezing point depressant and a C6-C16 organic acid salt corrosion inhibitor.
 [0008] There is still a need for a toxicological friendly antifreeze composition, i.e., a composition having improved
 thermal stability at low temperatures with minimal salt/deposition formation.

5 DETAILED DESCRIPTION

 [0012] Definitions for the following terms are provided herein to promote a further understanding of the invention.
 [0013] The term "antifreeze" refers to a composition which reduces the freezing point of an aqueous solution, or is an
 aqueous solution with a reduced freezing point with respect to water, e.g., a composition comprising a freezing point
10 depressant.
 [0014] The term "coolant" refers to a category of liquid antifreeze compositions which have properties that allow an
 engine to function effectively without freezing, boiling, or corrosion. The performance of an engine coolant must meet
 or exceed standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (A.S.T.M.) and the Society of Automotive
 Engineers (S.A.E.).
15 [0015] The term "heat transfer fluid" refers to a fluid which flows through a system in order to prevent its overheating,
 transferring the heat produced within the system to other systems or devices that can utilize or dissipate the heat.
 [0016] The term "de-icing" fluid refers to a fluid which makes or keeps a system, a device, or a part free of ice, or a
 fluid which melts ice.
 [0017] As used herein, the term "antifreeze" composition (or fluid or concentrate) may be used interchangeably with

 diluted with about 10-90 vol. % water prior to being used in cooling system or as an anti-freeze/de-icing fluid. In a second

 and 1 to parts by weight of the corrosion inhibitor combination.
 [0039] Properties: The composition is characterized as exhibiting excellent protection against the corrosion of metals.
 The composition is further characterized as being thermally stable.
 [0040] As used herein, "thermally-stable" means a sample of the antifreeze composition forms less than 2% precipitate
10 when chilled at 0°C. for at least 24 hours. In another embodiment, the term means that the composition is relatively free
 of precipitates (as visually observed) after being chilled at -15°C. for at least 24 hours. In yet another embodiment,
 "thermally-stable" means that less than 2% of the composition forms precipitates when chilled at -15°C. for at least 24
 hours. In a third embodiment, the term means that less than 1% of the composition forms precipitates when chilled at
 -15°C. for at least 24 hours. In a fourth embodiment, the composition forms less than 1 wt. % precipitates when chilled
15 at -25°C. for at least 24 hours. As used herein, "precipitate" means broadly to include insolubles, coagulants, flocculants,
 solids and/or fine particles, needles (from crystallization), crystals, gels, colloidal formations, aggregated or precipitated
 lumps, clusters, or granules which may suspend, deposit, or settle in the antifreeze composition.
 [0041] In one embodiment, the composition further exhibits improved thermal stability properties compared to the
 compositions of the prior art, wherein the composition remains relatively free of insolubles/precipitates at a freezing or
20 sub-freezing temperature and after a period of at least 24 hours. In one embodiment, the composition remains relatively
 transparent after at least 24 hours at a temperature of less than 0°C. In one embodiment, the composition remains
 thermally stable at a temperature of less than -5°C. In a second embodiment, the composition remains thermally stable
 at a temperature of less than - 10°C. In a third embodiment, the composition remains thermally stable at a temperature
 of less than -20°C.
25 [0042] Applications: Due to the thermal stability of the fluids and the excellent protection provided by the corrosion
 inhibitors, the antifreeze composition is especially useful in applications where it is desirable to provide long service life
 with minimal fluid change-outs or fluid modifications once in service. In one embodiment, the antifreeze composition is
 used in applications in which heat is to be supplied to petroleum materials drilled or transported in cold climates to
 improve the fluidity and decrease the viscosity of the petroleum materials. In another embodiment, the composition is
30 also useful in conventional applications for heat transfer fluids, such as coolants in industrial engines.
 [0043] In yet another embodiment, the composition can also be used in de-icing applications for melting ice away from
 aircrafts, equipment, etc.
